1. testweb folder, it is about front-end things
2. server, in here, I create api
3. to start testweb  using code npm run serve (need to install npm first)
4. to start server using node index
5. in testweb folder, use code: npm run build (in terminal)
to pack and can get a dist folder, this dist folder need to be put in server and to be deployed.
(this part I'm not sure, and may have some bug about url, like when we click 'home' and want to go to that page, the url changed but the page doesn't jump to home page, because I may need add some code to fix this problem, this problem may appear when deploy)
